Welcome to the first issue of <i>The Record</i> for this school year! COVID-19 has brought about significant change to our everyday lives at school, and <i>The Record</i> is no exception. But just like how students, faculty, and other members of the community have adapted, <i>The Record</i> is committed to continuing our mission of elevating the voices of everyone through sharing stories with the community. We invite you to join our meeting at 7:30 p.m. EST tonight to learn more about our plans for this year and how you can contribute.
