Title IX, implemented in 1972, forbids educational systems from discriminating on the basis of sex. Since its implementation, according to Womenâ€™s Sports Foundation, the percentage of women playing college sports has increased by 545%, and the percentage of women playing high school sports has increased by 990%. Unfortunately, equal access to sports did not result in equal attitudes toward female athletes. Different forms of discrimination still exist toward female athletes amongst peers, coaches, parents, trainers, doctors, and physical therapists. The biases are often so subtle that both the offender and the athlete may not even recognize them. These discriminatory attitudes impact the lessons of teamwork, grit, and leadership young girls and women should be learning from sports and can carry with them throughout their lives.
