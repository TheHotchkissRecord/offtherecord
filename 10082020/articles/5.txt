Recently, Trump hosted the Republican National Convention at the White House, and the only thing more astonishing than the fact that his speech was incredibly mundane and boring, was the fact that he openly opposed his own administration’s CDC guidelines. The CDC guidelines, as stated on their website, are “Cover your mouth and nose with a mask when around others,” while also reminding people, “The mask is not a substitute for social distancing.” Unfortunately, when Trump accepted the Republican nomination for the second term, out of 1,000 people who attended the convention, only a few wore masks or socially distanced.
