On April 29, the National Collegiate Athletic Association’s (NCAA) Board of Directors announced that student-athletes will now be able to accept compensation from sponsors and third-party companies. The move, which will benefit college athletes playing Division I, II, and III, started gaining traction in the fall of 2019 when California passed the Fair Pay to Play Act permitting endorsement deals for college athletes.
