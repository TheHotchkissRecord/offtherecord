Given the current COVID-19 crisis in the United States, a lot is riding on who gets elected in November. The major candidates (Joe Biden and Donald Trump) have very differing economic views on healthcare, infrastructure and jobs, climate change, and taxation. I’m going to give my input on which economic plan I think would be the most beneficial, breaking down each candidate’s economic plans (in simple terms) and what each could mean for America. Although Mr. Biden’s plans are expensive, in the long run, they are worth it. They will benefit the economy, environment, and healthcare systems of the United States. Even though it will end up costing those in the top one percent an estimated additional 100,000 dollars in taxes per year, I believe that for the greater good of the average person in America, and for future generations, Mr. Biden’s economic plan is better than President Trump’s.
