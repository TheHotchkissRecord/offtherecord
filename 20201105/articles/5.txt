“Each of you with every interaction has the power to tell somebody who they are. You have the power to tell somebody you think they’re a sinner, the power to tell somebody, just with your face, with your interaction, you think them a monster, or not,” said John Amaechi, psychologist, author, and ex-NBA star who identifies as gay, when he addressed the community last Wednesday, October 28. Amaechi’s speech marked the end of programs recognizing this year’s LGBT History Month.
