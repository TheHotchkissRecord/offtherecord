Teammate Carlos Martinez ’22 said, “[Dillon is] one of the hardest workers on the team. He puts in a lot of work and pushes us all until we have nothing left.  He’s also super passionate and it shows in games when he speaks and plays. He’s also good company, we all love to be around Dillon. He’s a funny guy who’s kind and relatable.”
