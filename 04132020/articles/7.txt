Shine Lee ’20 is a four-year senior, an avid cook, a member of the orchestra, and a poet. Angela Choi ’21, the orchestra’s concertmaster, says that “Shine’s laugh and smile lights up the orchestra rehearsal, and I’d hate to imagine first period Monday [rehearsal] without him.” In this issue, Arts & Leisure highlights the multiple forms of art in which Shine has been involved over his high school career.
