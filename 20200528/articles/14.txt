Obinna Okoli ’20 is a Senior and a four-year member of Boys Varsity Squash and Boys Varsity Track and Field. On the squash team, he played as the #3 seed this year; on the track team, he runs the 110 m and 300 m hurdles. His squash teammate John Nicholson ’22 said, “Obi is extremely reliable, on and off the court. In terms of his athletic ability, he had the best record on the team. Whenever he stepped on court, we could count on him to win, which is invaluable in the world of squash. Off the court, Obi was a great friend – easy to talk to, and a great listener.”
