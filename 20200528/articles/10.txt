Upon my arrival at Hotchkiss in the summer of 2011, as the spouse of an incoming math teacher with three small children, I realized this was to be an eye-opening experience. I grew up in a smaller conservative town on the West coast and had voted Republican my entire life. I have been politically active as long as I can remember, with one of my first politically meaningful experiences working on the Bob Dole presidential campaign during college. I had passed on an opportunity to work on another presidential campaign right before I arrived at Hotchkiss.
