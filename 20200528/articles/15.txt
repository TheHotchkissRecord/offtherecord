Jacqui Rice ’20 is a four-year senior and co-captain of Varsity Sailing. She has been sailing on Lake Wononscopomuc since her Prep year at Hotchkiss and also served as a Fairfield Farm Ecosystems and Adventure Team (FFEAT) leader for the fall season. Teammate Nicole Morikawa ’21 said, “She is the most thoughtful, considerate, and hard-working person I know. Even though our season [this year] was nonexistent, she would have made a great captain because of her innate kindness. I remember when I first joined the team, I was so nervous. Jacqui was one of my first and best friends on the team, and she was always there to offer support and advice.
