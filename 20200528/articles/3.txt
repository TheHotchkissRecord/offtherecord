Content preview: 
Each year, the Dorm Heads Committee selects proctors with input from academic advisors, dorm faculty, and current proctors. Before applicants are offered proctorship, their candidacy is reviewed by the dean of students, the dean of community life, the head of school, and class deans. Proctors are chosen based on six main criteria: being role models, demonstrating initiative, being trusted by and communicating well with peers and adults, being good listeners, and being inclusive. Due to the uncertain nature of housing plans as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, the proctor selection committee, made up of the dorm heads and various deans, will wait until the details of returning to campus are more clear before assigning proctors to specific dorms. If the community is unable to reconvene on campus in the fall, proctors for the 2020-2021 school year will still have a role in creating a sense of community for students virtually.
