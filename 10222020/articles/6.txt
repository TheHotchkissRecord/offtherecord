One of my earliest political memories, when I was only seven years old, was the ratification of the 26th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, which allowed the voting age across the United States to be lowered to 18. My father worked at the U.S. Embassy in Costa Rica at the time, and I remember sitting down with him in our house in San José to figure out when that meant I could first vote for president. I was disappointed to learn that I’d have to wait an extra two years—until I was 20—because there would be no presidential election when I first turned 18. The first year I could vote for president, 1984, seemed preposterously far away to my second grade brain.
