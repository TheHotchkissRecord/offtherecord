Romy Tarantino is a three-year Senior, co-captain of the Girls Varsity Soccer team, and member of the Girls Varsity Lacrosse team. Teammate Lydia Bullock ’22 said, “Romy is nothing short of a great leader. She fearlessly took the role of captain on the soccer team when we didn’t even have a season. She is so kind and never fails to make everyone around her feel like they fit right.”
