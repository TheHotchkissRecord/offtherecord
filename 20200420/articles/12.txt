Coach Andrew D’Ambrosio, head coach of the Boys Varsity Lacrosse Team, joined the school in 2017; he also serves as the dean of the Class of 2022 and instructor in history, philosophy, and religion. Mitchell Riley ’22 said, “Coach D’Ambrosio is so knowledgeable and expressively passionate about the game of lacrosse. In the past few years, he has begun to revitalize lacrosse at Hotchkiss with his dedication to our program. He asks all of us to buy-in to our culture, as he does the same. He’s a great leader for all of us, as players and as young men. He always has open ears for his players and is there to guide us through any obstacles we may face.”
