The Record is a community effort. It is not just our large editorial board that helps produce every weekly issueâ€”there are many more people involved. To give you an idea, we reach out to nearly 50 people for every eight-page issue. Without realizing it or not, nearly everyone in the community has contributed to The Record in some way: in an interview, in a photo, or an initiative The Record was covering.
