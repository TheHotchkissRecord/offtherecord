“What was the Earth’s warmest year on record?” 2016. In order to promote awareness for the protection of our ecosystem, the Student Environmental Association (SEA) is hosting an Eco Week from today to Friday, April 24. In past years, the community has conducted Eco Day, a day dedicated to serve the local community and educate ourselves on different aspects of the environment. Due to distance learning, Eco Day has been transformed into Eco Week; various clubs, like the Hotchkiss Political Union, Quizbowl, and Crafting Hands, will tailor their conversations and activities toward the environment. Mr. Mario Williams ’12, instructor in environmental science, said, “Everyone will be able to find an event that piques their interest and that encourages us to be more mindful about the environmental impacts of our daily decisions.”
