The “Notorious RBG” was a force to be reckoned with. On September 18, 2020, former Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg passed away after shaping a new life for American women. She fought for not only women’s rights, but the rights of every individual, regardless of race, gender, sexuality, socio-economic status or background. In the CNN documentary RBG about her life and work, Ginsburg quoted Sarah Grimké, an American abolitionist and mother of the women’s suffrage movement, and said, “I ask no favors of our sex. All I ask of our brethren is that they take their feet off our necks.”
