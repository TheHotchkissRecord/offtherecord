Content preview: 
David Vega ’20 is a four-year member of the Co-ed Varsity Ultimate Frisbee Team. He started playing Ultimate at Hotchkiss and is currently a co-captain alongside Isaac Alicea ’20 and Sandrine Brien ’20. Teammate, Toby Pouler ’20, said, “David Vega has been the heart and soul of the ultimate team for the past three years, both on and off the field. Either the 22 points he scored in New England’s last year or the fact that he always has a disk proves that. Although David suffered an injury to his ACL in the winter, his leadership never faltered, and Hotchkiss Ultimate was ready for another successful season under his guidance.”
